# Shoe Store Inventory App
1st Project of the [Android Kotlin Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-kotlin-developer-nanodegree--nd940)

## Project Overview
In this project, students will apply their skills in building layouts and navigation files by building a Shoe Store app. They will build an app with four screens:

1. Login
2. Onboarding
3. Shoe listing
4. Shoe detail page

## Room for improvement
This app could be potentially improved by using
 
* RecyclerView for listing the shoes on the List screen
* Room for persisting the user and shoe's data
* Two-way data binding
